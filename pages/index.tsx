                pixel of Mosaic! ðŸ¦„
                <br />
                <br />
                Draw on the Mosaic Canvas up to the Merge TTD, when your pixels
                become permanent. Be the last one to write into the old Ethereum
                state!
                <br />
                <br />
                Win a pixel before the Merge by painting over others or bidding
                ETH to show your zeal! Minimum bid is 0.001 ETH and the new bid
                amount is sent to the previous owner. So you earn money if you
                lose your beloved pixels! Get in early!
                <br />
                <br />
                Unleash your artsy inner self and mint an NFT of your Mosaic
                pixels! Be the first ETH-ers to have an NFT on ETH 2.0 that
                represents the history.
                <br />
                <br />
                Showcase your community spirit, support the ETH, and own a proof
                you were part of the historical moment of ETH Merge!
                <br />
                <br />
                PS: Pixels are free for grab and you can gain ETH from the next
